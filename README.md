This C++ program reads a file containing numbers and prints the sum and product of the contents.

The purpose of this program is to overcome the size limitation of C++ datatypes that limit how
large a number could be by creating a class that uses strings to perform addition, subraction,
and multiplication while maintaining the precision of the number.

To run this program:
   1) make run.o
   2) run.o <filename>
